        <h2>What Auto Insurance Actually Covers</h2>
        <p>South Dakota requires auto insurance to drive legally, but the state minimums are just a starting point — not a recommendation. Here's what the different pieces do:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Liability (required)</strong> — pays for injuries and property damage you cause to others in an accident. South Dakota's minimum is 25/50/25 — that's $25,000 per person for bodily injury, $50,000 per accident, and $25,000 for property damage.</li>
          <li><strong>Collision</strong> — pays to repair or replace your vehicle after an accident, regardless of who's at fault. You choose a deductible ($250–$1,000 typically).</li>
          <li><strong>Comprehensive</strong> — covers everything that isn't a collision: hail, theft, vandalism, fire, flooding, and animal strikes.</li>
          <li><strong>Uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM)</strong> — mandatory in South Dakota. Every auto policy must include UM/UIM coverage. It pays your costs when the other driver has no insurance or not enough to cover your damages.</li>
          <li><strong>Medical payments (MedPay)</strong> — covers medical expenses for you and your passengers after an accident, regardless of fault.</li>
        </ul>

  <!-- Common Pitfalls -->

      <div class="info-content">
        <h2>Common Pitfalls and Costly Mistakes</h2>
        <p>Auto insurance seems straightforward until something goes wrong. These are the issues that catch South Dakota drivers off guard:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Carrying only state minimums</strong> — The 25/50/25 minimum sounds like a lot until you rear-end a new truck ($60,000+) or cause an injury that requires surgery. If your liability limit is $25,000 and the bill is $80,000, you owe the remaining $55,000 out of pocket. It happens more than you'd think.</li>
          <li><strong>Skipping comprehensive to save money</strong> — South Dakota is one of the top states for both deer strikes and hail damage. Dropping comprehensive coverage to save $15/month can cost you an entire vehicle.</li>
          <li><strong>Carrying low UM/UIM limits</strong> — South Dakota requires UM/UIM on every auto policy, but the limits you carry matter. If your UM/UIM is at the state minimum and an uninsured driver puts you in the hospital, that $25,000 per person limit won't go far. Match your UM/UIM to your liability limits at minimum.</li>
          <li><strong>Not understanding your deductible</strong> — A $1,000 deductible lowers your premium, but can you actually pay $1,000 out of pocket tomorrow? Pick a deductible you can afford when it matters.</li>
          <li><strong>Rental car gaps</strong> — If your car is in the shop after an accident, rental reimbursement coverage pays for a loaner. Without it, you're paying out of pocket for weeks while repairs happen.</li>
          <li><strong>Teenager on the policy</strong> — Adding a young driver dramatically increases premiums. An independent agent can compare how different carriers rate young drivers — the difference between companies can be hundreds of dollars per year.</li>
          <li><strong>Lapsed coverage penalties</strong> — Letting your auto insurance lapse, even for a short period, can result in significantly higher rates when you reinstate. Carriers see gaps in coverage as a red flag.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Driving in South Dakota</h2>
        <p>This state has driving conditions that directly affect what coverage you need:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Deer collisions</strong> — South Dakota consistently ranks in the top 5 states for deer-vehicle collisions. Peak season is October through December. Comprehensive coverage is essential, not optional.</li>
          <li><strong>Summer hailstorms</strong> — A single storm can damage thousands of vehicles. Hail claims go through comprehensive coverage, and your deductible applies. After big storms, adjusters can be backed up for weeks.</li>
          <li><strong>Long rural stretches</strong> — When you're 30 miles from the nearest town, a breakdown is more than an inconvenience. Roadside assistance and towing coverage matter here more than in most states.</li>
          <li><strong>Winter road conditions</strong> — Black ice, blowing snow, and whiteout blizzards make November through March the highest-risk months for collision claims.</li>
          <li><strong>Farm vehicles on public roads</strong> — Tractors, grain carts, and slow-moving equipment are common on South Dakota roads. Rear-end collisions with farm equipment can be serious.</li>
        </ul>

  <!-- Why an Independent Agent -->
  <section class="info-section fade-in">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="info-content">
        <h2>Why This Is a Job for an Independent Agent</h2>
        <p>Auto insurance rates vary wildly between companies — same driver, same car, same coverage, and one carrier might charge 40% more than another. The only way to find out is to compare, and that's exactly what independent agents do. They write with many different carriers and can show you real numbers side by side.</p>
        <p>They also know the details that matter in South Dakota specifically: which carriers handle hail claims quickly, which ones penalize you least for a deer strike, and which ones offer the best multi-policy discounts when you bundle auto with home or farm.</p>
        <p>After an accident, your agent is the one who picks up the phone. They deal with the adjuster, coordinate with the body shop, and make sure your rental car is set up — so you can focus on everything else.</p>

      <div class="info-content">
        <h2>Helpful Questions to Ask Your Agent</h2>
        <p>These will help you have a productive first conversation and make sure nothing important slips through:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Am I carrying enough liability to protect my assets, or am I sitting at the state minimum?</li>
          <li>Do my uninsured/underinsured motorist limits match my liability limits?</li>
          <li>What's my comprehensive deductible — and does it make sense given how common hail and deer strikes are here?</li>
          <li>Do I have rental car reimbursement, and how much does it cover per day and for how long?</li>
          <li>If I add my teenager to the policy, which carriers are going to give me the best rate?</li>
          <li>What happens to my rate if I file a comprehensive claim for hail or a deer hit — does it count against me?</li>
          <li>Am I getting every discount I qualify for — multi-policy, safe driver, good student, low mileage?</li>
