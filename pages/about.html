        <h2>What Is an Independent Insurance Agent?</h2>
        <p>The key difference is simple: a captive agent works for one insurance company and can only sell that company's products. An independent agent is free to write policies with many different carriers. That freedom is what makes them independent — and it's what makes them valuable to you.</p>
        <p>Because they aren't locked into a single company, independent agents can compare coverage, pricing, and claims track records across dozens of insurers. They find the policy that fits <em>your</em> situation, not the one that earns their employer the highest commission.</p>
        <p>Independent agents are small business owners rooted in their communities. They live where you live, understand the local landscape, and have a personal stake in making sure their neighbors are properly protected.</p>

        <h2>Why Choose an Independent Agent?</h2>
        <p>There are real, practical reasons to work with an independent agent — especially in South Dakota.</p>

          <h3>Freedom to Write with Many</h3>
          <p>A captive agent has one company's products to sell. An independent agent can write with many different carriers — giving you real options, competitive pricing, and coverage built around your needs.</p>

          <div class="card-icon">&#127966;</div>
          <h3>Local Expertise</h3>
          <p>Your agent understands South Dakota — the weather, the economy, the risks specific to your area. From prairie hailstorms to the unique needs of ag operations, local knowledge matters.</p>

          <h3>Personal Advocate</h3>
          <p>When you need to file a claim, your independent agent goes to bat for you. And because they can move your business to another carrier, insurance companies have real incentive to treat you right.</p>

        <h2>About the Independent Insurance Agents of South Dakota</h2>
        <p>The Independent Insurance Agents of South Dakota (IIASD) is the statewide trade association representing independent insurance agencies across the state. Our member agencies are locally owned small businesses that serve communities in every corner of South Dakota.</p>
        <p>IIASD supports its members through continuing education, advocacy at the state legislature, industry networking, and resources that help independent agencies serve their clients better. We believe that the independent agency model — where agents are free to write with many companies instead of being captive to one — delivers the best outcomes for South Dakotans.</p>
        <p>Our mission is simple: to strengthen and promote independent insurance agents so that every South Dakotan has access to expert, unbiased insurance guidance from someone they know and trust.</p>
